They prefer heavy, spiked armor and simple weapons, such as greatswords. They sometimes trade with drow and duergar, who acknowledge the productivity of their mines.

The Chultan humans refer to themselves as Tabaxi - a great clan of their ancestors. Regardless of this common name, the Tabaxi live in small clan villages, recognizing no central ruler. Each clan is lead by a council of the eldest members, male and female alike.\n\nThe Tabaxi get their living from the jungle, mostly foraging and hunting. They distrust those who seek wealth and power, and prefer to only own goods they can use. The jungle is full of strange creatures, from wild dwarves to dinosaurs, but goblins must be the most common of the Tabaxiâ€™s enemies.\n\nThe Chultansâ€™ attitude towards magic is contradictory: On one hand, the arcane is respected and each clan has one or a couple of arcanists in its ranks. On the other, unsanctioned practice of the Art is considered dangerous and is not allowed. The welfare of the clan is always above that of an individual, which is why magic must be used only by the clan mage, to further the clanâ€™s cause.\n\nThere are three dominant forms of religion among Tabaxi people, though all differ greatly from the usual FaerÃ»nian traditions. Most dominant is the worship of Ubtao, who is considered to have created the jungle and everything in it. Another group, spirit-worshippers, may recognize Ubtao as the creator, but worship a plethora of spirits and elementals as active powers in the Realms. Jungle druids are concerned with the jungle itself, and do not take part in the argument between Ubtao-priests and spiritlords.\n\nThe Tabaxi do not know or wear heavy armor, as metal is a precious commodity.

They make up the bulk of the population in Thesk, Impiltur, the Vast and of course Damara. Many can also be found in Vaasa and the Moonsea region. They are medium-sized folk with tawny-to-fair skin and usually straight, brown or dark hair. In Damaran minds, there is a very stark contrast between good and evil, and they expect people to earn trust with their actions. Many are drawn to adventure in order to prove their heroism â€“ or to escape the bonds of the moralistic society.\n\nDamaran society is quite lawful, apart from Aglarond, where strong elven presence and the rule of the Simbul leave their mark on society, and the Vast. Social status is determined by deed rather than birth, so there is no distinct separation between the lower and upper classes. Damarans are very religion-centered people, and most go to a church school to learn their chosen profession. The most central deity in Damaran culture is Ilmater, who represents their endurance and self-sacrifice. A variety of other gods from the FaerÃ»nian pantheon are revered, including Chauntea, Tempus, Torm, SelÃ»ne, Valkur, Umberlee and Mystra, among others.\n\nDue to their moral character, many Damaran adventurers become paladins or monks. Other divine classes are common as well, due to their tendency for religious devotion and self-sacrifice. Fighters and rogues are not as common as elsewhere, since there is no mercenary tradition and only one notable thieves' guild. Arcane magic is oft treated with suspicion, though wizards that help society are accepted. Sorcerers are shunned due to the demonic history of Narfell. Damarans favour magic that provides some sort of protection, and this tradition is visible both among clerics and wizards, who are often abjurers or diviners."},{"id":1237,"text":"Durpari"},{"id":1238,"text":"Abilities: +2 CHA, -1 STR, -1 CON, Bonus Feat: Artist, Default Human Traits\n\nThe Durpari are the relatively short, dark-skinned inhabitants of Durpar, Estagund, Veldorn, and Var the Golden. They are considered skilled traders and are a warm and friendly people. The Durpari have dwelt along the shores of the Golden Water since before the rise of the Imaskari empire. The fall of Imaskar precipitated the fall of the Durpari kingdoms and two millennia of barbarism. During this period, the Mulan of Mulhorand often slaughtered or enslaved the Durpari tribes. In â€“623 DR, the first Durpari kingdoms after the fall of Imaskar arose along the shores of the Golden Water, as Mulan influence over the region ebbed in the face of the burgeoning threat from Narfell and Raumathar. With the exception of Estagund, which was briefly conquered by the armies of Dambrath during the reign of Reinhar I in 551 DR, the Durpari have remained independent ever since, trading among themselves and with their neighbors.\n\nThe Durpari speak a language of the same nameâ€”derived from a mixture of Draconic, Mulhorandi, and Rauricâ€”and employ the Thorass alphabet brought back from the west.\n\nThe Durpari venerate a small pantheon of deities known collectively as the Adama, and thought to include SelÃ»ne, Oghma, Gond, Torm, and Waukeen."},{"id":1239,"text":"Ffolk"},{"id":1240,"text":"Abilities: +1 WIS, +1 CON, -1 STR, -1 INT, Skills: +2 Animal Empathy, +2 Lore, Default Human Traits\n\nThe Moonshae islands are located in the Sea of Swords, due west of Amn and the southern Sword Coast. In fact, Amia lies north-west of the Moonshaes, and many ships sailing between FaerÃ»n and Amia stop by the islands on their way. The native people of the Moonshaes are known as the Ffolk, as opposed to the seafaring Northmen in the northern sections of the islands. Their hair is dark and their skin tan. The islands of Moray, Gwynneth and Alaron are split into several small nations of the Ffolk, though they are ultimately lead by High Queen Alicia Kendrick who resides in Caer Callidyrr. The Ffolk practice agriculture and therefore interact little with other cultures. They are an isolated people who are generally suspicious towards outlanders.\n\nThe Ffolk are very close to nature. Their religious worship is centered around the Earthmother whom they believe to be the land itself, instead of a human-shaped goddess. The Earthmother is actually an aspect of Chauntea, but she is not merely the goddess of agriculture on the Moonshaes: she is the supreme goddess of nature and life, the maintainer of Balance. Native Ffolk usually do not worship other gods; instead, they regard foreign clerics as threats to the Balance.\n\nDue to the Ffolk's strong religious beliefs, it stands to reason that druids are the most honoured individuals on the Moonshaes. Youngsters are encouraged to take up the path of the druid if only they are capable, and the islands are full of small druid groves. Bards are respected as sages, entertainers, spies and heroes. There are no native clerics among the Ffolk, as the Earthmother doesn't seem to care about them.

Their two main deities are the lord of the sky, Teylas, and Etugen, the goddess of the earth. Elsewhere on FaerÃ»n they're known as Akadi and Grumbar. Each tribe also has several lesser deities and spirits they worship. Beast cults, such as that of the horse, are common. Important locations like mountains and oases also have their own guardian spirits who must be revered. The Tuigan have no evil gods, as misfortunes are blamed either on evil spirits or angering a deity.

Even when one is spotted, few think the fellow is anything more but a graceful halfling.\n\nElflings resemble hins more than elves: they are short and merry. Theyâ€™re considerably prettier and more graceful than normal halflings. Elfling skin and hair colour depend on the subrace of the parents, though few manage to grow as impressive moustache or sideburns as the short side of the family.\n\nCombining the enthusiasm and love for life hins have and the aesthetical interests of the elves, elflings are often considered a blessing in the hafling community they happen to be born in. They are celebrated as gifts from the gods. Due to this, many elflings develop a strong confidence, even a slight sense of superiority. Charismatic and pleasant folk as they are, this does not make them any less popular, though. One trait all elflings have in common is the inevitable wanderlust that burns in them. Coming from both sides of the family, its allure is simply too great for an elfling to resist for long.\n\nVirtually all elflings are adventurers of some sort. Most excel in the arts of the bard and those who donâ€™t, often become skilled rogues. Because of their unusual bloodline, many elflings also have an exceptional tie to the Weave: a good deal of elflings manifest sorcerous powers at one point in life.
