# Notice

This repository contains a loose collection of custom content for Neverwinter Nights (NWN), including haks, models, textures, and other user-contributed assets. The content is provided *as-is*, and is a community-driven effort to share and preserve resources for Amia.

## Disclaimer

All content in this repository is provided *as-is*, with no guarantees or warranties. The contributors and maintainers of this repository are not responsible for any damages, issues, or losses that may arise from the use of the content.

The assets within this repository are provided by other users of Neverwinter Nights, and as such, the ownership and licensing of each individual asset belong to the original creators. As a result, it is advised that you browse [neverwintervault](https://neverwintervault.org/) to curate custom content instead.

## Licensing

Since the content in this repository consists of various assets provided by different creators, there is no unified license for the entire collection. You are free to use, modify, and distribute any content in accordance with the individual licenses or permissions granted by the original creators. Please respect the licensing terms of each asset as applicable.

tl;dr: This is a disparate collection of variously licensed things that are used to build Amia's haks. We can provide no guarantees of its use for repackaging.
